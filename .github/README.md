# MutantFinder

### What Does It Do?
MutantFinder is a survey app that matches the user with the most compatible mutant (including possible user added iterations) based on the survey question responses.

### How to use:
Open the website and answer the questions. The program will do the rest for you.

While adding the name and imageUrl, remember that other people can see this if they have the URL. Also, please use a real image link so that future iterations will have an actual image display if they match your responses.
